We are thrilled to announce the official release of the first version of **Cedro**, an innovative JavaScript library written in TypeScript, designed to simplify the creation of complex user interfaces. Cedro is widget-based, offering a straightforward and efficient way to build modern applications.

## What is Cedro?

Cedro is a library that enables developers to create user interfaces using elements known as widgets. These widgets form the core of Cedro, offering an intuitive API and an object-oriented structure. With Cedro, developers can choose from a wide range of widgets, customize them as needed, or even create new widgets for specific situations.

## Why Choose Cedro?

-   **Ease of Use**: Cedro is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. Its API is easy to learn, and its clear documentation allows developers to quickly start building complex interfaces.

-   **Flexibility**: Whether youâ€™re creating a simple interface or an application with multiple interactive components, Cedro provides the flexibility to do so.

-   **Based on TypeScript**: Cedro leverages the full power of TypeScript, offering a safer and more efficient development environment with full support for static types, code autocompletion, and refactoring tools.

## What to Expect

With this first release of Cedro, we are laying a solid foundation upon which we plan to build and expand in future updates. Key features include:

-   A wide variety of ready-to-use widgets.
-   Full support for TypeScript.
